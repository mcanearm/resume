	abstract = {Recently, new top-level domain extensions have been created that allow web-masters
more customizability in their URL structures, with such endings as “.io,” “.rs,” and “.xyz,” to
name a few. Although these top-level domains allow the creation of shorter domains that
were previously taken by .coms, there is a potential tradeoff in memory recall. Users may
remember domains ending in .com better despite a longer domain name simply because
.com is the de facto default top-level domain.

We conducted an experiment to test this hypothesis and analyzed the results using both
a traditional logistic regression and a mixed methods logistic regression framework.
We found that the total length of the domain, not a particular extension, was the most
significant predictor of whether or not a participant correctly recalled a particular domain.
We have identified areas for future improvement in the study.},
