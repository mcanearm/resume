# Research Experience

## Graduate Student, University of Michigan \hfill 2022-present
### Department of Statistics, Advised by Dr. Yang Chen

- Applied Gaussian process regression with novel contaminated noise extension to predict geomagnetic perturbations.
- Compiled the results of the model outputs into a manuscript, published in Data Science in Science.
- Currently, I am exploring the use of Kernelized Stein Discrepancy scores for recalibrating prediction intervals
of arbitrary regressors when the marginal target distribution is known.

## Research Assistant, Cooperative Institute for Great Lakes Research \hfill 2023-present
### SEAS/NOAA, advised by Dr. Yi Hong and Dr. Dani Jones

- Fit multiple statistical models to predict Great Lakes water levels from climate forecasting re-analysis data (CFRS)
- Focused in particular on an autoregressive Gaussian process with hierarchical hyper-parameters.
- Performed a model comparison to identify methods with best prediction interval coverage and accuracy.

### Research Assistant

# Employment Experience

## Point Predictive 

### Senior Data Scientist \hfill 2021-present

* Fit statistical models for predicting early loan default and chargeoff for auto lenders
* Write performant SQL for real-time and aggregate historical borrower statistics
* Load customer data into multiple database environments
* Implemented DynamoDB-backed solution for simple database lookups to improve AWS Lambda cold start times

## Clear Capital 
### Senior Machine Learning Engineer \hfill 2019-2021

* Principal engineer for Clear Capitalâ€™s AVM, a system that produces 150 million new predictions and 150GB of new data each week.
* Implemented a model-based error prediction procedure to create value ranges around AVM estimates
* Provide developer support and manage AWS infrastructure for the machine learning team, including launching and managing Amazon Quicksight dashboards for model analysis and validation.
* Designed and administer Redshift-based data warehouse to power machine learning models, ETL workflows, and ad-hoc analytical queries.
* Write, train, and deploy machine learning models on serverless and cloud infrastructure.

### Data Scientist II \hfill 2017-2019
* Led team of five to simplify original AVM model, allowing more frequent, accurate, and cheaper builds, saving over $4,000 on compute costs each month and improving AVM performance from last place to industry leader in 6 months (based on absolute mean prediction error).
* Created lightweight web interfaces in R and Shiny for team usage in model validation and exploration.
* Designed and deployed the S3 storage and DynamoDB metadata layer for an internal photo application that manages 35+ terabytes of photos.
* Gained familiarity with a wider array of machine learning models, most notably random forests.

### Data Scientist I \hfill 2015-2017
* Built an automated valuation model (AVM) on commodity hardware to predict home prices using R and PostgreSQL
* Implemented multi-model aggregation system for final prediction of house values on a monthly refresh cycle.
* Profiled and optimized R, Python, and SQL code for efficiency
* Built basic webservices in Python, Flask, and AWS Lambda for serving AVM model predictions and internal company data through a RESTful interface.


## Seer Interactive \hfill 

### Data Scientist \hfill 2014-2015

* Designed and carried out web-based experiment on domain recognition using robust
analytical methods, including multivariate regression and hierarchical modeling
* Wrote web-crawlers and multithreaded programs in Python for large-scale data collection jobs
* Utilized Linux-based computing resources in the cloud and on premises for batch processing, monthly reporting, and ad-hoc data analysis
* Automated repetitive reporting processes for large clients, including a hospital chain valued at $10 billion, by writing functions and scripts in R, Python, and Bash
* Wrote scripts and applications to extract data from various APIs and load them into databases stored both locally and in the cloud
* Supported analytics account managers and website tracking projects with external clients through project planning, KPI identification, and Google Analytics code implementation
